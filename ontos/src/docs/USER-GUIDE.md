## Core Concepts

Understanding these foundational concepts will help you effectively use Ontos.

![Ontos Object Model](/ontos-obj-model.svg)

### Domains

**Domains** represent logical groupings of data based on business areas or organizational structure. They provide high-level organization for your data assets.

- **Hierarchical**: Domains can have parent-child relationships (e.g., "Retail" → "Retail Operations")
- **Examples**: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Customer, Product, Supply Chain
- **Purpose**: Group related data products and provide clear ownership boundaries

### Teams

**Teams** are collections of users and groups working together on data initiatives.

- **Members**: Can include individual users or Databricks workspace groups
- **Domain Assignment**: Teams can be associated with specific domains
- **Role Overrides**: Individual members can have custom roles within the team
- **Metadata**: Track team information like Slack channels, leads, and tools

### Projects

**Projects** are workspace containers that organize team initiatives with defined boundaries.

- **Types**: 
  - **Personal**: Individual user workspaces (auto-created)
  - **Team**: Shared workspaces for collaborative work
- **Team Assignment**: Multiple teams can collaborate on a project
- **Isolation**: Provides logical boundaries for development work

### Datasets

**Datasets** are logical groupings of related data assets that represent physical implementations across your data platforms.

- **Logical Grouping**: Combine related assets (main table + dimensions + lookups + metrics) into a cohesive unit
- **Physical Instances**: Each dataset can have multiple physical implementations across different systems and environments
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Native connectivity to Unity Catalog, with pluggable connectors for Snowflake, Kafka, Power BI, and more
- **Unified Asset Types**: All assets use a common type system (`uc_table`, `uc_metric`, `snowflake_view`, `kafka_topic`, etc.)
- **Contract Linking**: Datasets can implement Data Contracts, ensuring they meet defined specifications
- **Lifecycle**: Draft → Active → Deprecated → Retired
- **Marketplace Ready**: Published datasets appear in the data marketplace for discovery

**Key Concept**: A Dataset is the "what exists" (physical reality), while a Data Contract is the "what should exist" (specification). Datasets can span multiple platforms while maintaining a single governance view.

### Data Contracts

**Data Contracts** define the technical specifications and guarantees for data assets following ODCS v3.0.2 standard.

- **Schema Definition**: Column names, types, constraints, and descriptions
- **Quality Guarantees**: Data quality rules and SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
- **Semantic Linking**: Connect schemas and properties to business concepts
- **Lifecycle**: Draft → Proposed → Under Review → Approved → Active → Certified → Deprecated → Retired
- **Versioning**: Track contract evolution over time

### Data Products

**Data Products** are curated collections of Databricks assets (tables, views, models) delivered as consumable products.

- **Product Types**: Source, Source-Aligned, Aggregate, Consumer-Aligned
- **Input/Output Ports**: Define data flows and dependencies
- **Tags**: Organize and discover products using standardized tags
- **Status**: Development → Sandbox → Pending Certification → Certified → Active → Deprecated

### Semantic Models

**Semantic Models** provide a knowledge graph connecting technical data assets to business concepts.

- **Business Concepts**: High-level domain concepts (Customer, Product, Transaction)
- **Business Properties**: Specific data elements (email, firstName, customerId)
- **Semantic Linking**: Three-tier system linking contracts, schemas, and properties to business terms
- **RDF/RDFS**: Based on standard ontology formats for interoperability

### Compliance Policies

**Compliance Policies** are rules that automatically check your data assets for governance requirements.

- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**: Write rules in a SQL-like declarative syntax
- **Entity Types**: Check catalogs, schemas, tables, views, functions, and app entities
- **Actions**: Tag non-compliant assets, send notifications, or fail validations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Run policies on schedules to track compliance over time

### Connectors (Platform Integrations)

**Connectors** are pluggable components that enable Ontos to discover and manage assets from different data platforms.

- **Unified Interface**: All connectors implement the same asset discovery and metadata API
- **Platform-Agnostic Governance**: Write policies that work across Unity Catalog, Snowflake, Kafka, etc.
- **Extensible Architecture**: New connectors can be added without changing core governance logic
- **Native UC Support**: Unity Catalog connector is fully implemented with support for tables, views, functions, models, volumes, and metrics

**Currently Available:**
- **Databricks/Unity Catalog**: Full support for all UC object types including AI/BI metrics

**Planned Connectors:**
- **Snowflake**: Tables, views, streams, stages, functions
- **Apache Kafka**: Topics, Schema Registry schemas
- **Microsoft Power BI**: Datasets, semantic models, dashboards, reports

## Getting Started

When you first access Ontos as an enterprise, the application will be empty. Here's how to set up your data governance foundation.

### Initial Setup Checklist

1. **Configure Roles and Permissions** (Admin task)
2. **Create Domain Structure**
3. **Set Up Teams**
4. **Define Initial Projects**
5. **Load Semantic Models** (Optional)
6. **Create Compliance Policies**
7. **Begin Creating Datasets, Contracts, and Products**

**Tip**: See the [Growing with Ontos](#growing-with-ontos) section for a recommended progression path from datasets → contracts → products → compliance.

### Step 1: Configure Roles and Permissions

**Who**: System Administrator

Navigate to **Settings → RBAC** to configure roles and permissions.

#### Default Roles

Ontos comes with predefined roles:

- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Data Governance Officer**: Broad governance capabilities
- **Data Steward**: Review and approve contracts/products
- **Data Producer**: Create and manage contracts/products
- **Data Consumer**: Read-only access to discover data

#### Assign Groups to Roles

1. Go to **Settings → RBAC → Roles**
2. Select a role (e.g., "Data Steward")
3. Click **Edit** and assign Databricks workspace groups
4. Configure **Deployment Policies** to control catalog/schema access

**Example Deployment Policy**:
```json
{
  "allowed_catalogs": ["dev_*", "staging_*", "prod_analytics"],
  "allowed_schemas": ["*"],
  "default_catalog": "dev_team",
  "default_schema": "default",
  "require_approval": true,
  "can_approve_deployments": false
}
```

This policy allows the role to deploy to catalogs matching `dev_*` or `staging_*` patterns.

### Step 2: Create Domain Structure

**Who**: Data Governance Officer or Admin

Navigate to **Domains** in the sidebar.

#### Creating Your First Domain

1. Click **Create Domain**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: A unique identifier (e.g., "Finance")
   - **Description**: Clear description of the domain scope
   - **Parent Domain**: Optional parent (e.g., "Core" as root)
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags for categorization

3. Click **Create**

#### Example Domain Hierarchy

```text
Core (root)
├── Finance
│   ├── Accounting
│   └── Treasury
├── Sales
│   ├── Retail Sales
│   └── Enterprise Sales
├── Customer
└── Product
```

**Best Practice**: Start with 3-5 high-level domains and expand as needed. Avoid creating too many domains initially.

### Step 3: Set Up Teams

**Who**: Domain Owners or Admins

Navigate to **Teams** in the sidebar.

   - **Owner Team**: Primary team responsible for the project
   - **Metadata**: Add documentation links, timelines, etc.

3. Assign additional teams if needed
4. Click **Create**

**Personal Projects**: Each user automatically gets a personal project (e.g., `project_jsmith`) for individual experimentation.

### Step 5: Load Semantic Models (Optional)

**Who**: Data Governance Officer or Admin

Semantic models provide business context for your data. Ontos includes sample taxonomies, or you can create custom ones.

#### Using Built-in Taxonomies

Navigate to **Semantic Models** to explore pre-loaded concepts:

- **Business Concepts**: Customer, Product, Transaction, etc.
- **Business Properties**: email, firstName, customerId, etc.

These are loaded from RDF/RDFS files at:
- `/src/backend/src/data/taxonomies/business-concepts.ttl`
- `/src/backend/src/data/taxonomies/business-properties.ttl`

#### Adding Custom Concepts

Contact your administrator to add custom RDF/RDFS files to the taxonomies directory. After adding files, restart the application to load them.

### Step 6: Create Compliance Policies

**Who**: Data Governance Officer or Security Officer

Navigate to **Compliance** in the sidebar.

#### Creating Your First Policy

1. Click **Create Policy**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Table Naming Conventions")
   - **Description**: What the policy checks
   - **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - **Category**: Governance, Security, Quality, etc.

3. Write the compliance rule using the DSL (see [Compliance Checks](#compliance-checks) section)

4. Click **Save**

#### Example Starter Policy

```text
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view'] AND obj.catalog = 'prod'
ASSERT HAS_TAG('data-product') OR HAS_TAG('excluded-from-products')
ON_FAIL FAIL 'All production assets must be tagged with a data product'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_status: 'untagged'
```

This policy ensures all production tables and views are organized into data products.

2. Ontos infers schema from Unity Catalog (if UC-backed)
3. Enrich with:
   - Column descriptions and business meaning
   - Data quality rules (not null, valid ranges, patterns)
   - SLOs (freshness, availability, accuracy targets)
   - Semantic links to business concepts
4. Submit for Data Steward review
5. Link the approved contract back to your dataset

**Example**:
```yaml
Contract: Customer Data Contract v1.0.0
Status: Active
Implements Schema: customers

Properties:
  - customer_id (string, required, unique)
    → Linked to: "customerId" business property
  
  - email (string, required, unique, PII)
    → Linked to: "email" business property
    Quality Rule: Must match email pattern
  
  - created_at (timestamp, required)
    Quality Rule: Cannot be in the future

SLOs:
  - Freshness: Updated daily by 6 AM UTC
  - Completeness: >99% for required fields
```

**Benefits at This Stage**:
- ✅ Formal quality commitments

**What to Do**:
1. Navigate to **Products** → **Create Product**
2. Define product metadata:
   - Name, description, owner team
   - Product type (Source, Aggregate, Consumer-Aligned)
3. Link to your data contracts
4. Define input/output ports:
   - Where data comes from
   - What data is delivered
5. Add tags and documentation
6. Submit for review and publish to marketplace

**Example**:
```yaml
Product: Customer 360 View
Type: Aggregate
Status: Active

Description: Comprehensive customer profile combining 
  CRM, transactions, and support interactions.

Implements Contracts:
  - Customer Data Contract v1.0.0

  - customer-master-dataset (Dataset)
  - transaction-history (Table)
  
Output Ports:
  - customer_360_enriched (Delta Table)
    Location: main.analytics.customer_360
    Contract: Customer 360 Contract v1.0.0
```

**Benefits at This Stage**:
- ✅ Clear value proposition for consumers
- ✅ Self-service discovery in marketplace
- ✅ Defined data lineage
- ✅ Product-oriented thinking
- ✅ Formalized input/output contracts

### Stage 4: Govern with Compliance Checks

**Goal**: Automate quality monitoring and policy enforcement.

**Who**: Data Governance Officers, Data Stewards

**What to Do**:
1. Navigate to **Compliance** → **Create Policy**
2. Write rules using the Compliance DSL:
   - Naming conventions
   - Documentation requirements
   - Security policies (PII handling)
   - Quality thresholds
3. Schedule automated runs
4. Set up notifications for violations
5. Track compliance scores over time

**Example Policies**:

**Policy 1: All Production Assets Must Have Contracts**
```text
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view'] AND obj.catalog = 'prod'
ASSERT HAS_TAG('data-contract')
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Production assets must be linked to a data contract'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_issue: 'missing_contract'
```

**Policy 2: Dataset Ownership Required**
```text
MATCH (ds:dataset)
WHERE ds.status = 'active'
ASSERT ds.owner_team != '' AND ds.owner_team != null
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Active datasets must have an owner team assigned'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'data-governance@company.com'
```

**Policy 3: Contract Quality SLOs**
```text
MATCH (contract:data_contract)
WHERE contract.status = 'active'
ASSERT HAS_TAG('slo_defined') AND TAG('slo_freshness') != ''
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Active contracts must have freshness SLOs defined'
```

**Benefits at This Stage**:
- ✅ Automated policy enforcement
- ✅ Proactive issue detection
- ✅ Continuous quality monitoring
- ✅ Compliance reporting
- ✅ Reduced manual review burden

## Managing Datasets

Datasets are the entry point for bringing your existing data assets into Ontos. They represent logical groupings of related physical tables and views.

### What is a Dataset?

A Dataset is:
- A **logical container** for related data assets (main table + dimensions + lookups + metrics)
- A **registry** of physical implementations across multiple platforms and environments
- A **bridge** between raw assets and formal Data Contracts
- A **discoverable entity** in the data marketplace
- A **platform-agnostic** abstraction over Unity Catalog, Snowflake, Kafka, Power BI, and other systems

**Key Distinction**:
- **Dataset** = What physically exists (tables, views, metrics, topics across platforms)
- **Data Contract** = What should exist (specification, quality rules)
- **Data Product** = How value is delivered (packaged, documented, monitored)

**Multi-Platform Capability**: Ontos uses a pluggable connector architecture to support assets from multiple platforms. Unity Catalog is fully supported with native connectivity. Connectors for Snowflake, Kafka, and Power BI are planned for future releases.

### Viewing Datasets

Navigate to **Datasets** in the sidebar to see all registered datasets:

- Dataset name and description
- Status (Draft, Active, Deprecated, Retired)
- Associated data contract (if linked)
- Owner team
- Number of physical instances
- Subscriber count

### Creating a Dataset

    └── prod_catalog.reference.regions (Production)
```

**Benefits**:
- Single point of discovery for related data
- Clear ownership across all related assets
- Consistent contract application
- Simplified impact analysis

### Multi-System Support

Ontos uses a **pluggable connector architecture** that supports multiple data platforms through a unified asset registry. This enables you to manage assets from different systems within the same governance framework.

#### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Connector | Status | Supported Asset Types |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Databricks Unity Catalog** | `databricks` | ✅ Active | Tables, Views, Functions, Models, Volumes, Metrics, Notebooks, Jobs, Pipelines |
| **Snowflake** | `snowflake` | 🔜 Planned | Tables, Views, Streams, Stages, Functions, Procedures, Tasks |
| **Apache Kafka** | `kafka` | 🔜 Planned | Topics, Schemas (Schema Registry) |
| **Microsoft Power BI** | `powerbi` | 🔜 Planned | Datasets, Semantic Models, Dashboards, Reports, Dataflows |
| **Cloud Storage** | Various | 🔜 Planned | S3 Buckets/Objects, ADLS Containers, GCS Buckets |

#### Physical Path Formats

| System | Physical Path Format | Example |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Unity Catalog | `catalog.schema.table` | `prod.crm.customers` |
| Snowflake | `DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE` | `ANALYTICS.CRM.CUSTOMERS` |
| Kafka | `topic_name` | `customer-events` |
| Power BI | `workspace/dataset` | `Analytics/Customer360` |
| S3 | `s3://bucket/path/` | `s3://data-lake/customers/` |

#### Unified Asset Types

Each dataset instance can specify an **asset type** that identifies the kind of asset across platforms:

**Unity Catalog Assets:**
- `uc_table` - Managed or external tables
- `uc_view` - Standard views
- `uc_materialized_view` - Materialized views
- `uc_streaming_table` - Streaming tables (DLT/SDP)
- `uc_function` - User-defined functions
- `uc_model` - Registered ML models
- `uc_volume` - Unity Catalog volumes
- `uc_metric` - AI/BI metrics (first-class support)

**Other Platforms (when connectors are implemented):**
- `snowflake_table`, `snowflake_view`, `snowflake_stream`
- `kafka_topic`, `kafka_schema`
- `powerbi_dataset`, `powerbi_semantic_model`, `powerbi_dashboard`

**Benefits of Unified Asset Types:**
- Platform-agnostic governance policies
- Consistent metadata model across systems
- Simplified search and discovery
- Future-proof for new platform integrations

Instances can span multiple systems within the same dataset, enabling cross-platform data governance.

## Creating Data Contracts

Data Contracts define formal specifications for data assets following the ODCS v3.0.2 standard.

### Why Data Contracts?

- **Consumer-Centric**: Define clear expectations for data consumers
- **Quality Guarantees**: Formalize data quality commitments (SLOs)
- **Breaking Change Prevention**: Contract versioning prevents unexpected changes
- **Semantic Clarity**: Link technical schemas to business concepts
- **Governance**: Enable approval workflows and compliance checks

### Contract Structure

A complete data contract includes:

1. **Metadata**: Name, version, owner, description
2. **Schema Objects**: Tables, views with their properties
3. **Properties**: Columns with types, constraints, and descriptions
4. **Service Level Objectives**: Availability, freshness, quality targets
5. **Authoritative Definitions**: Semantic links to business concepts
6. **Terms**: Usage restrictions, privacy requirements

### Creating a Contract

Navigate to **Contracts** and click **Create Contract**.

#### Basic Information

- **Name**: Unique contract identifier (e.g., "customer-data-contract")
- **Version**: Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0")
- **Owner Team**: Responsible team
- **Domain**: Business domain
- **Status**: Draft (initial state)
- **Description**:
  - **Purpose**: What data and why
  - **Usage**: How consumers should use it
  - **Limitations**: Constraints and restrictions

#### Adding Schema Objects

1. Click **Add Schema Object**
2. Enter details:
   - **Name**: Logical name (e.g., "customers")
   - **Physical Name**: Actual UC table (e.g., "main.customer_domain.customers_v2")
   - **Description**: What the schema represents
   - **Type**: Table, View, Model, etc.

3. Add **Authoritative Definitions** (optional but recommended):
   - Click **Add Semantic Link**
   - Search for a business concept (e.g., "Customer")
   - Select the concept to link

#### Adding Properties (Columns)

For each schema object:

1. Click **Add Property**
2. Fill in details:
   - **Name**: Column name (e.g., "customer_id")
   - **Logical Type**: String, Integer, Date, etc.
   - **Required**: Is this field mandatory?
   - **Unique**: Must values be unique?
   - **Description**: What this field contains
   - **PII**: Does it contain personally identifiable information?

3. Add **Authoritative Definition** for the property:
   - Search for a business property (e.g., "customerId")
   - Link to provide semantic meaning

#### Example Contract Structure

```yaml
Name: Customer Data Contract
Version: 1.0.0
Owner Team: data-engineering
Domain: Customer
Status: draft

Description:
  Purpose: Core customer master data for enterprise applications
  Usage: Customer profiles, preferences, and transaction history
  Limitations: PII encrypted at rest; 7-year retention policy

Schema Objects:
  1. customers (table)
     Physical: main.customer_domain.customers_v2
     Semantic: → Business Concept "Customer"
     
     Properties:
       - customer_id (string, required, unique)
         Semantic: → Business Property "customerId"
       
       - email (string, required, unique, PII)
         Semantic: → Business Property "email"
       
       - first_name (string, required)
         Semantic: → Business Property "firstName"
       
       - last_name (string, required)
         Semantic: → Business Property "lastName"
       
       - date_of_birth (date, optional, PII)
         Semantic: → Business Property "dateOfBirth"

Service Level Objectives:
  - Availability: 99.9%
  - Freshness: Updated daily by 6 AM UTC
  - Completeness: >99% for required fields
  - Accuracy: <0.1% invalid emails
```

### Semantic Linking (Three-Tier System)

Ontos supports semantic linking at three levels:

#### 1. Contract-Level Links

Link the entire contract to a business domain concept.

**Example**: "Customer Data Contract" → "CustomerDomain" business concept

**When to Use**: High-level domain classification

#### 2. Schema-Level Links

Link schema objects (tables, views) to specific business entities.

**Example**: "customers" table → "Customer" business concept

**When to Use**: The schema represents a specific business entity

#### 3. Property-Level Links

Link individual columns to business properties.

**Example**: "email" column → "email" business property

**When to Use**: Every important data element (recommended for all columns)

**Benefits**:
- Enables semantic search ("find all tables with customer email")
- Provides business glossary integration
- Supports data lineage and impact analysis
- Facilitates cross-domain data discovery

## Semantic Models

Semantic Models provide a knowledge graph that connects technical data assets to business concepts.

### What are Semantic Models?

Semantic Models define:
- **Business Concepts**: High-level domain entities (Customer, Product, Order)
- **Business Properties**: Specific data elements (email, firstName, productId)
- **Relationships**: How concepts relate to each other
- **Hierarchies**: Taxonomies and categorizations

### Viewing Semantic Models

Navigate to **Semantic Models** in the sidebar.

**What You'll See**:
- List of business concepts
- List of business properties
- Concept details (definition, examples, relationships)
- Property details (data type, format, constraints)

### Using Semantic Models

#### Linking Contracts to Concepts

When creating a data contract:

1. At **Contract Level**: Link to high-level domain concept
   - Example: "Customer Data Contract" → "CustomerDomain"

2. At **Schema Level**: Link table to specific entity
   - Example: "customers" table → "Customer" concept

3. At **Property Level**: Link column to business property
   - Example: "email" column → "email" property

#### Benefits of Semantic Linking

1. **Discovery**: Find all tables containing "customer email"
2. **Consistency**: Ensure "email" field has same format everywhere
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generate business glossary
4. **Lineage**: Track business concepts through transformations
5. **Compliance**: Check policies based on semantic meaning

### Semantic Search

Use the search bar to find assets by business concept:

**Examples**:
- Search "customer" → Find all assets linked to Customer concept
- Search "email" → Find all columns representing email addresses
- Search "PII" → Find all assets containing personal information

### Exploring Concept Relationships

Click on a concept to see:
- **Definition**: What this concept means
- **Properties**: Which business properties belong to this concept
- **Related Concepts**: Parent/child and associated concepts
- **Linked Assets**: Which contracts, schemas, and tables use this concept

### Custom Semantic Models

To add custom business concepts and properties:

1. Create RDF/RDFS files defining your concepts
2. Place files in `/src/backend/src/data/taxonomies/`
3. Restart the application
4. Concepts will be available in the semantic linking dialogs

**RDF Format Example**:

```turtle
@prefix ontos: <http://example.com/ontology#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

ontos:Subscription a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Subscription" ;
    rdfs:comment "Customer subscription to a service or product" ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ontos:BusinessConcept .

ontos:subscriptionId a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "Subscription ID" ;
    rdfs:comment "Unique identifier for a subscription" ;
    rdfs:domain ontos:Subscription ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

## Compliance Checks

Compliance Policies automate governance by checking data assets against defined rules.

### Compliance DSL

The Compliance Domain-Specific Language (DSL) enables you to write declarative rules similar to SQL.

#### DSL Structure

```text
MATCH (entity:Type)
WHERE filter_condition
ASSERT compliance_condition
ON_PASS action
ON_FAIL action
```

**Components**:
- **MATCH**: Which entities to check
- **WHERE**: Filter entities (optional)
- **ASSERT**: The compliance rule to verify
- **ON_PASS**: Actions when rule passes
- **ON_FAIL**: Actions when rule fails

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equality | `obj.status = 'active'` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `obj.owner != 'unknown'` |
| `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | Comparison | `obj.score >= 95` |
| `MATCHES` | Regex match | `obj.name MATCHES '^[a-z_]+$'` |
| `IN` | List membership | `obj.type IN ['table', 'view']` |
| `CONTAINS` | Substring | `obj.description CONTAINS 'PII'` |
| `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` | Boolean logic | `obj.active AND NOT obj.deprecated` |

### Built-in Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HAS_TAG(key)` | Check tag exists | `HAS_TAG('data-product')` |
| `TAG(key)` | Get tag value | `TAG('domain') = 'finance'` |
| `LENGTH(str)` | String length | `LENGTH(obj.name) <= 64` |
| `UPPER(str)` | To uppercase | `UPPER(obj.name)` |
| `LOWER(str)` | To lowercase | `LOWER(obj.name) = obj.name` |

### Available Actions

| Action | Syntax | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `PASS` | `PASS` | Mark as passed (default) |
| `FAIL` | `FAIL 'message'` | Mark as failed with message |
| `ASSIGN_TAG` | `ASSIGN_TAG key: 'value'` | Add/update tag |
| `REMOVE_TAG` | `REMOVE_TAG key` | Remove tag |
| `NOTIFY` | `NOTIFY 'email@company.com'` | Send notification |

### Entity Types

You can write rules for:

**Unity Catalog Objects**:
- `catalog` - Catalogs
- `schema` - Schemas
- `table` - Tables
- `view` - Views
- `function` - Functions
- `volume` - Volumes
- `model` - Registered ML models
- `metric` - Unity Catalog metrics (AI/BI)

**Cross-Platform Objects** (when connectors available):
- `topic` - Kafka topics
- `stream` - Snowflake streams
- `dashboard` - Power BI dashboards
- `semantic_model` - Power BI semantic models

**Application Entities**:
- `data_product` - Data products
- `data_contract` - Data contracts
- `dataset` - Datasets
- `dataset_instance` - Dataset instances (with `asset_type` filtering)
- `domain` - Domains
- `glossary_term` - Glossary terms
- `review` - Review requests

**Generic**:
- `Object` - Matches all entity types

### Example Policies

#### Policy 1: Naming Conventions

**Requirement**: All tables use lowercase_snake_case; views must start with `v_`

```text
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view']
ASSERT
  CASE obj.type
    WHEN 'view' THEN obj.name MATCHES '^v_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$'
    WHEN 'table' THEN obj.name MATCHES '^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$'
  END
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Names must be lowercase_snake_case. Views must start with "v_"'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_issue: 'naming_violation'
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ `customer_orders` (table)
- ✅ `v_active_customers` (view)
- ❌ `CustomerOrders` (table - uppercase)
- ❌ `orders_view` (view - missing `v_` prefix)

#### Policy 2: PII Data Protection

**Requirement**: All PII data must be encrypted with AES256

```text
MATCH (tbl:table)
WHERE HAS_TAG('contains_pii') AND TAG('contains_pii') = 'true'
ASSERT TAG('encryption') = 'AES256'
ON_FAIL FAIL 'PII data must be encrypted with AES256'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG security_risk: 'high'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'security-team@company.com'
ON_PASS ASSIGN_TAG last_compliance_check: '2025-01-15'
```

**What it checks**:
- Tables tagged with `contains_pii: true`
- Must have `encryption: AES256` tag
- On failure: tags as high risk and alerts security team
- On success: updates last check timestamp

#### Policy 3: Data Product Ownership

**Requirement**: All active data products must have a valid owner

```text
MATCH (prod:data_product)
WHERE prod.status IN ['active', 'certified']
ASSERT prod.owner != 'unknown' AND LENGTH(prod.owner) > 0
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Active data products must have a valid owner assigned'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG needs_attention: 'missing_owner'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'data-governance@company.com'
ON_PASS REMOVE_TAG needs_attention
```

#### Policy 4: Production Asset Tagging

**Requirement**: All production assets must be tagged with a data product

```text
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view'] AND obj.catalog = 'prod'
ASSERT HAS_TAG('data-product') OR HAS_TAG('excluded-from-products')
ON_FAIL FAIL 'All production assets must be tagged with a data product or marked as excluded'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_status: 'untagged'
ON_PASS REMOVE_TAG compliance_status
```

#### Policy 5: Schema Documentation

**Requirement**: All schemas must have meaningful descriptions

```text
MATCH (sch:schema)
WHERE sch.catalog != 'temp'
ASSERT
  sch.comment != '' AND
  LENGTH(sch.comment) >= 20
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Schemas must have a description of at least 20 characters'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG documentation_status: 'incomplete'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'data-documentation-team@company.com'
ON_PASS ASSIGN_TAG documentation_status: 'complete'
```

- **Properties Panel**: Configure selected node settings

#### Designer Tips

- Click a node to select and edit its properties
- Connect nodes by dragging from output to input handles
- Use the minimap for navigation in complex workflows
- Auto-layout organizes nodes automatically

### Default Workflows

Ontos includes pre-configured default workflows that cover common governance patterns. These can be edited or duplicated but not deleted.

#### Validation Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Naming Convention Validation** | On Create (catalog, schema, table) | Validates lowercase_snake_case naming |
| **Table Pre-Creation Validation** | Before Create (table) | Checks naming and reserved words |
| **Data Contract Schema Validation** | On Create (data_contract) | Ensures schema is defined |
| **Pre-Creation Compliance** | Before Create (catalog, schema, table) | Runs policy checks before creation (disabled by default) |

#### Approval Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Data Product Publish Approval** | On Status Change (data_product) | Requires domain owner approval for publishing |
| **Dataset Review Request** | Review Request (dataset) | Data Steward approval for datasets |

| **Dataset Update Notification** | On Update (dataset) | Notifies subscribers of changes |
| **PII Detection and Classification** | On Create (table) | Detects and tags PII columns (disabled by default) |
| **Job Failure Notification** | Job Failure (job) | Alerts administrators |
| **Job Success Notification** | Job Success (job) | Notifies requester (disabled by default) |
| **Subscription Welcome** | Subscription (dataset) | Welcome message to subscribers (disabled by default) |
| **Access Expiring Warning** | Expiring (access_grant) | Warns users before access expires |
| **Access Revoked Notification** | Access Revoked (access_grant) | Notifies users of revocation |

### Editing a Default Workflow

Default workflows can be customized:

1. Navigate to **Compliance → Workflows**
2. Click on a default workflow
3. Click **Edit**
4. Modify steps, add new steps, or change configuration
5. Click **Save**

**Tip**: Use **Duplicate** to create a copy before making major changes.

### Duplicating a Workflow

Create a copy of any workflow:

1. Click the actions menu (⋮) on a workflow row
2. Select **Duplicate**
3. Enter a new name
4. Click **Duplicate**
5. Edit the copy as needed

### Workflow Execution

#### How Workflows Run

1. **Trigger Event**: An entity event matches a workflow's trigger
2. **Scope Check**: Workflow scope is evaluated (all, project, catalog, domain)
3. **Step Execution**: Steps run in sequence following on_pass/on_fail paths
4. **Result**: Workflow ends at a Pass or Fail terminal step

#### Blocking vs Non-Blocking

- **Blocking Workflows** (before_create, before_update): Prevent the action if workflow fails
- **Non-Blocking Workflows**: Run asynchronously; failures don't prevent the triggering action

#### Approval Pausing

Approval steps pause workflow execution:

1. Workflow reaches approval step
2. Notification sent to approvers
3. Workflow status becomes "Paused"
4. Approver makes decision via notification
5. Workflow resumes with on_pass or on_fail path

### Workflow Best Practices

#### Design Principles

1. **Keep It Simple**: Start with minimal steps; add complexity as needed
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for workflows and steps
3. **Handle Failures**: Always define on_fail paths for important steps
4. **Notify Users**: Include notification steps for visibility
5. **Test First**: Disable new workflows and test before enabling

#### Common Patterns

**Validation → Auto-Fix → Notify Pattern**:
```yaml
Steps:
  1. Validate condition
     on_pass → success
     on_fail → auto-fix

  2. Auto-fix (assign_tag)
     on_pass → success
     on_fail → notify

  3. Notify (on failure)
     on_pass → fail

  4. Success (pass)
  5. Fail (fail)
```

**Request → Approve → Notify Pattern**:
```yaml
Steps:
  1. Notify requester (confirmation)
     on_pass → request-approval

  2. Request approval
     on_pass → notify-approved
     on_fail → notify-rejected

  3. Notify approved
     on_pass → success

  4. Notify rejected
     on_pass → fail

  5. Success (pass)
  6. Fail (fail)
```

#### Performance Considerations

- Avoid complex workflows on high-frequency triggers (on_update)
- Use scopes to limit workflow execution to relevant entities
- Disable unnecessary default workflows
- Monitor workflow execution times in logs

### Troubleshooting Workflows

#### Workflow Not Firing

1. Check workflow is **Active**
2. Verify trigger type matches the event
3. Check entity types include the affected entity
4. Verify scope includes the entity (project, catalog, domain)

#### Step Failing Unexpectedly

1. Check step configuration for typos
2. Verify validation rule syntax
3. Check approver roles/groups exist
4. Review backend logs for detailed errors

#### Approval Not Received

1. Verify approver role/group is configured correctly
2. Check notifications are not filtered/blocked
3. Ensure approvers have notification access

## Asset Review Workflow

The Asset Review feature enables Data Stewards to formally review and approve Databricks assets before they're promoted to production.

### What is Asset Review?

Asset Review is a governance workflow where:
- Data Producers request review of assets (tables, views, functions)
- Data Stewards examine asset definitions and data quality
- Stewards approve, reject, or request clarifications
- System tracks review history and decisions

### Creating a Review Request

**Who**: Data Producer or Data Engineer

1. Navigate to **Asset Reviews**
2. Click **Create Review Request**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Reviewer**: Select a Data Steward
   - **Notes**: Explain what needs review and why
   
4. Add assets to review:
   - Click **Add Asset**
   - Enter fully qualified name (e.g., `main.sales.orders`)
   - Select asset type (table, view, function, model, volume, metric, dashboard, topic, etc.)
   - Repeat for all assets

5. Click **Submit Request**

**Example Request**:
```text
Reviewer: data.steward@company.com
Notes: Pre-production review for Q4 sales dashboard assets. 
       Please verify schema consistency and data quality.

Assets:
  1. main.staging.orders_cleaned (table)
  2. main.staging.v_orders_summary (view)
  3. main.staging.fn_calculate_revenue (function)
```

### Reviewing Assets

Navigate to **Asset Reviews** to see pending requests.

#### Review Process

1. Click on a review request
2. For each asset:
   
   **a. View Definition**
   - Click **View Definition**
   - Review CREATE TABLE/VIEW statement
   - Check schema, constraints, comments
   
   **b. Preview Data** (for tables)
   - Click **Preview Data**
   - Examine sample rows (default: 25)
   - Check data quality and patterns
   
   **c. AI Analysis** (optional)
   - Click **Analyze with AI**

   - Get suggestions and warnings
   
   **d. Make Decision**
   - Select action: **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Needs Clarification**
   - Add comments explaining the decision
   - Click **Submit Decision**

3. Once all assets are reviewed, finalize the request:
   - Click **Complete Review**
   - Request status changes to **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Needs Review**

#### AI-Assisted Review

The system can analyze asset definitions using AI:

**What AI Checks**:
- Schema design issues
- Missing comments/documentation
- Potential data quality problems
- Security concerns (e.g., unencrypted PII)
- Best practice violations

**How to Use**:
1. Click **Analyze with AI** on an asset
2. Wait for analysis (typically 10-30 seconds)
3. Review findings:
   - **Warnings**: Potential issues found
   - **Suggestions**: Improvements to consider
   - **Security**: Security-related concerns

4. Use findings to inform your decision

**Note**: AI analysis is a tool to assist, not replace, human judgment.

### Review Statuses

#### Request Statuses

- **Queued**: Newly created, awaiting review
- **In Review**: Steward is actively reviewing
- **Needs Review**: Requester must address concerns
- **Approved**: All assets approved, ready for promotion
- **Rejected**: Request rejected, assets cannot be promoted

#### Asset Statuses

- **Pending**: Awaiting review
- **Approved**: Asset passed review
- **Rejected**: Asset failed review
- **Needs Clarification**: Issues found, requester must respond

### Responding to Review Feedback

**Who**: Data Producer

If a review request returns with **Needs Review** status:

1. Open the review request
2. Read steward comments
3. Address issues:
   - Fix asset definitions
   - Improve data quality
   - Add missing documentation

5. Add notes explaining changes
6. Steward will re-review

### Review History

All review decisions are tracked:

- **Audit Trail**: Who reviewed what and when
- **Comments**: Rationale for decisions
- **History**: Multiple review rounds for the same asset
- **Reporting**: Generate compliance reports

Navigate to **Audit Trail** to see detailed review history.

### Best Practices

**For Requesters**:
- Provide context in notes
- Ensure assets have documentation
- Run your own quality checks first
- Group related assets in one request
- Respond promptly to feedback

**For Reviewers**:
- Use the AI analysis as a starting point
- Check schema documentation
- Verify naming conventions
- Review data samples
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Explain rejection reasons clearly

### Viewing Your Permissions

Click your profile icon (top right) → **My Profile** to see:
- Your assigned roles
- Groups you belong to
- Effective permissions
- Role overrides from team memberships

### Permission Levels

Each feature has permission levels:

- **No Access**: Feature not visible
- **Read Only**: View only, no modifications
- **Read/Write**: Full CRUD operations
- **Admin**: Full access including configuration

### Deployment Policies

Deployment policies control which Unity Catalog catalogs and schemas users can deploy to.

#### Viewing Your Deployment Policy

Navigate to **My Profile → Deployment Policy** to see:
- Allowed catalogs (list or patterns)
- Allowed schemas (list or patterns)
- Default catalog/schema
- Whether deployments require approval
- Whether you can approve others' deployments

#### Template Variables

Deployment policies support dynamic values:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{username}` | Email prefix | `jdoe` from `jdoe@company.com` |
| `{email}` | Full email | `jdoe@company.com` |
| `{team}` | Primary team | `data-engineering` |
| `{domain}` | User's domain | `Finance` |

**Example Policy**:
```json
{
  "allowed_catalogs": [
    "{username}_sandbox",
    "shared_dev",
    "staging"
  ],
  "allowed_schemas": ["*"],
  "default_catalog": "{username}_sandbox",
  "default_schema": "default"
}
```

For user `alice@company.com`, this resolves to:
- Allowed: `alice_sandbox`, `shared_dev`, `staging`
- Default: `alice_sandbox.default`

#### Pattern Matching

Policies support wildcards and regex:

**Wildcards**:
- `*` - Match anything
- `user_*` - Match `user_alice`, `user_bob`, etc.
- `*_sandbox` - Match `alice_sandbox`, `team_sandbox`, etc.

**Regex** (surround with `^` and `$`):
- `^prod_.*$` - Match catalogs starting with `prod_`
- `^[a-z]+_sandbox$` - Match lowercase names ending with `_sandbox`

### Team Role Overrides

Users can have different roles in different teams:

**Example**:
- Global role: **Data Consumer**
- In "analytics-team": **Data Producer** (override)
- In "finance-domain-team": **Data Steward** (override)

This allows flexible, context-specific permissions.

## MCP Integration (AI Assistants)

Ontos provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that enables AI assistants (like Claude, GPT, or custom LLM agents) to programmatically discover and execute tools within your data governance platform.

### What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol** is a standard for AI assistants to interact with external systems. It allows:

- **Tool Discovery**: AI assistants can discover what operations are available
- **Secure Execution**: Tools are executed with scope-based authorization
- **Programmatic Access**: Automate data governance workflows via AI

### Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AI-Powered Search** | Ask "Find all data products related to customer analytics" |
| **Automated Documentation** | Generate contract documentation from natural language |
| **Governance Chatbot** | Answer questions about data lineage and ownership |
| **Compliance Queries** | Check compliance status across domains |
| **Semantic Discovery** | Find entities by business concept (e.g., "all tables with customer email") |

### MCP Tokens

MCP tokens are API keys that authenticate AI assistants to the MCP endpoint. Each token has:

- **Name**: Descriptive identifier
- **Scopes**: Permissions granted (what tools can be used)
- **Expiration**: Optional time limit
- **Audit Trail**: Last used timestamp and creation info

#### Creating an MCP Token

**Who**: Administrators

1. Navigate to **Settings → MCP Tokens**
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Assistant - Analytics Team")
   - **Description**: Purpose of this token
   - **Scopes**: Select required permissions (see [Available Scopes](#available-scopes))
   - **Expiration**: Optional expiry time

4. Click **Create**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the generated token immediately. It will only be shown once.

**Example Token Configuration**:
```yaml
Name: claude-assistant-analytics
Description: Claude assistant for analytics team queries
Scopes:
  - data-products:read
  - contracts:read
  - semantic:read
  - search:read
Expiration: 90 days
```

#### Managing Tokens

**View Tokens**: Navigate to **Settings → MCP Tokens** to see all tokens with:
- Name and description
- Scopes granted
- Created by and when
- Last used timestamp
- Expiration status

**Revoke Token**: Click **Revoke** to immediately disable a token. Revoked tokens cannot be restored.

**Delete Token**: Permanently remove a token and its audit history.

### Available Scopes

Scopes control which tools an MCP token can access. Use the principle of least privilege.

#### Read Scopes

        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "X-API-Key": MCP_TOKEN
        },
        json={
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "tools/call",
            "params": {
                "name": tool_name,
                "arguments": arguments
            },
            "id": 1
        }
    )
    return response.json()

# Search for data products
result = call_mcp_tool("search_data_products", {"query": "customer"})
print(result)
```

#### cURL Examples

**List available tools**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-ontos-instance/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MCP_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

**Search data products**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-ontos-instance/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MCP_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "search_data_products",
      "arguments": {"query": "customer analytics"}
    },
    "id": 2
  }'
```

**Find entities by concept**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-ontos-instance/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MCP_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "find_entities_by_concept",
      "arguments": {"concept_iri": "http://example.com/ontology#Customer"}
    },
    "id": 3
  }'
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Token Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the scopes needed
2. **Use Expiration**: Set expiration for temporary integrations
3. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate tokens periodically (e.g., every 90 days)
4. **Audit Usage**: Monitor `last_used_at` for unusual patterns
5. **Revoke Immediately**: Revoke tokens when no longer needed or compromised

#### Scope Recommendations

| Integration Type | Recommended Scopes |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Discovery Chatbot | `*:read`, `search:read` |
| Documentation Generator | `contracts:read`, `data-products:read`, `semantic:read` |
| Compliance Monitor | `contracts:read`, `data-products:read`, `analytics:read` |
| Full Automation | Specific write scopes as needed |

#### Network Security

- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider IP allowlisting for sensitive integrations
- Monitor for unusual request patterns

### Error Handling

The MCP endpoint returns standard JSON-RPC 2.0 errors:

| Error Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `-32600` | Invalid request format |
| `-32601` | Method not found |
| `-32602` | Invalid params |
| `-32603` | Internal error |
| `-32000` | Tool execution error |
| `-32001` | Unauthorized (invalid/missing token) |
| `-32003` | Forbidden (insufficient scopes) |

**Example Error Response**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32003,
    "message": "Insufficient scope: requires 'data-products:write', token has ['data-products:read']"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Health Check

Use the health endpoint to verify connectivity:

```bash
curl https://your-ontos-instance/api/mcp/health
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Delivery Modes

Delivery Modes control how Ontos persists and propagates changes to external systems when entities (Data Products, Data Contracts, Datasets, Domains, Roles, Tags) are created or updated.

### What are Delivery Modes?

When you create or update an entity in Ontos, the change can be **delivered** to external systems in different ways:

- **Direct Mode**: Automatically apply changes to Unity Catalog (e.g., GRANTs, permissions)
- **Indirect Mode**: Export changes as YAML files to a Git repository for GitOps/CI-CD workflows
- **Manual Mode**: Generate actionable notifications for administrators to apply changes manually

Multiple modes can be active simultaneously. For example, you might use Direct mode for immediate access grants while also persisting all changes to Git for version history and audit trails.

### Delivery Modes Overview

```

### Direct Mode

**Purpose**: Automatically apply changes directly to connected systems using the service principal.

**Use Cases**:
- Grant access permissions immediately when a Data Product is published
- Update Unity Catalog tags when metadata changes
- Apply security policies to new datasets

**How It Works**:
1. Entity is created or updated in Ontos
2. Delivery Service detects active Direct mode
3. Grant Manager applies the appropriate changes to Unity Catalog
4. Changes take effect immediately

**Configuration**:
1. Navigate to **Settings → Delivery**
2. Enable **Direct Mode**
3. Optionally enable **Dry Run** to test without applying changes

**Dry Run Mode**: When enabled, Direct mode will log what changes *would* be applied without actually executing them. Useful for testing and validation.

**Example Scenario**:
```text
User creates a Data Product with output port:
  → Direct Mode triggers
  → Grant Manager applies SELECT permission to the output table
  → Data consumers can immediately query the table
```

### Indirect Mode

**Purpose**: Export entity changes as YAML files to a Git repository for GitOps workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and version-controlled configuration management.

**Use Cases**:
- Maintain version history of all governance configurations
- Trigger CI/CD pipelines when configurations change
- Enable infrastructure-as-code patterns for data governance
- Audit trail through Git commit history
- Multi-environment promotion (dev → staging → prod)

**How It Works**:
1. Entity is created or updated in Ontos
2. Delivery Service detects active Indirect mode
3. Entity is serialized to YAML using File Models
4. YAML file is written to the local Git repository
5. Administrator reviews and pushes changes to remote

#### Git Repository Setup

Before using Indirect mode, configure the Git repository:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Git**
2. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository URL**: HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/ontos-state.git`)
   - **Branch**: Target branch (e.g., `main`)
   - **Username**: Git username (or leave empty for PAT-only auth)
   - **Token**: Personal Access Token with repository write permissions

3. Click **Save Settings**
4. Click **Clone Repository** to clone the repo to the configured volume

**Creating a GitHub PAT**:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set a descriptive name and expiration
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full repository access)
5. Generate and copy the token

#### YAML File Structure

Entities are exported in a Kubernetes-style resource format:

```yaml
apiVersion: ontos/v1
kind: DataProduct
metadata:
  name: customer-360-view
  id: "abc123-def456"
  createdAt: "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  updatedAt: "2026-01-24T14:45:00Z"
spec:
  title: Customer 360 View
  version: "2.1.0"
  status: active
  ownerTeam: analytics-team
  domain: Customer
  description: Comprehensive customer profile...
  inputPorts:
    - name: crm-data-input
      sourceType: data-product
      sourceId: customer-master-data
  outputPorts:
    - name: customer_360_enriched
      type: table
      location: main.analytics.customer_360_v2
      dataContractId: customer-data-contract-v1
```

#### Supported Entity Types

The following entities are exported to YAML:

| Entity Type | File Path Pattern | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Data Product | `data-products/{id}.yaml` | `data-products/abc123.yaml` |
| Data Contract | `data-contracts/{id}.yaml` | `data-contracts/def456.yaml` |
| Dataset | `datasets/{id}.yaml` | `datasets/ghi789.yaml` |
| Data Domain | `data-domains/{id}.yaml` | `data-domains/jkl012.yaml` |
| App Role | `roles/{id}.yaml` | `roles/mno345.yaml` |
| Tag Namespace | `tags/{id}.yaml` | `tags/pqr678.yaml` |

#### Git Operations

**Status**: View the current repository state
1. Navigate to **Settings → Git**
2. The status panel shows:
   - Clone status (Not Cloned, Cloned, Error)
   - Current branch
   - Last sync time
   - Pending changes count

**Pull**: Fetch latest changes from remote
1. Click **Pull** to update local repository
2. Useful before making changes to ensure you have the latest state

**Diff**: Review pending changes
1. Click **View Diff** to see uncommitted changes
2. Review added, modified, and deleted files
3. Verify changes before committing

**Push**: Commit and push changes to remote
1. Click **Push Changes**
2. Enter a commit message describing the changes
3. Click **Commit & Push**
4. Changes are pushed to the configured remote branch

**Workflow Example**:
```text
1. Create Data Product in Ontos UI
   ↓
2. YAML file written: data-products/abc123.yaml
   ↓
3. Navigate to Settings → Git → View Diff
   ↓
4. Review changes, click Push Changes
   ↓
5. Enter commit message: "Add customer-360-view data product"
   ↓
6. Changes pushed to Git remote
   ↓
7. CI/CD pipeline triggered (optional, external)
```

### Manual Mode

**Purpose**: Generate actionable notifications for administrators when changes require human intervention in external systems.

**Use Cases**:
- Changes that cannot be automated (legacy systems, external tools)
- High-risk changes requiring human approval and execution
- Organizations with strict change control processes
- Environments where automated access is restricted

**How It Works**:
1. Entity is created or updated in Ontos
2. Delivery Service detects active Manual mode
3. A notification is created with:
   - Change details (entity type, ID, what changed)
   - Instructions for manual action
   - Link to the entity
4. Administrator receives notification
5. Administrator performs manual action in external system
6. Administrator marks notification as completed

**Configuration**:
1. Navigate to **Settings → Delivery**
2. Enable **Manual Mode**

**Notification Example**:
```text
Title: Manual Delivery Required: Data Product Updated
Type: delivery
Entity: DataProduct (customer-360-view)
Change: PRODUCT_UPDATE
User: alice@company.com

Action Required:
Apply the following changes in Unity Catalog:
- Update tags on table main.analytics.customer_360_v2
- Verify access permissions match contract requirements

[Mark Complete] [View Entity]
```

### Configuring Delivery Modes

Navigate to **Settings → Delivery** to configure delivery modes.

#### Delivery Settings Panel

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Direct Mode** | Enable automatic application of changes to Unity Catalog |
| **Direct Dry Run** | Test direct mode without applying changes |
| **Indirect Mode** | Enable YAML export to Git repository |
| **Manual Mode** | Enable notification-based manual delivery |

#### Recommended Configurations

**Development Environment**:
```text
Direct Mode: ✓ (enabled)
Direct Dry Run: ✓ (enabled for testing)
Indirect Mode: ✓ (enabled for tracking)
Manual Mode: ✗ (disabled)
```

**Staging Environment**:
```text
Direct Mode: ✓ (enabled)
Direct Dry Run: ✗ (disabled)
Indirect Mode: ✓ (enabled for CI/CD triggers)
Manual Mode: ✗ (disabled)
```

**Production Environment (GitOps)**:
```text
Direct Mode: ✗ (disabled - changes flow through GitOps)
Indirect Mode: ✓ (enabled - source of truth)
Manual Mode: ✓ (enabled - for exceptions)
```

**Production Environment (Direct)**:
```text
Direct Mode: ✓ (enabled)
Indirect Mode: ✓ (enabled - for audit trail)
Manual Mode: ✗ (disabled)
```

### Error Handling

Delivery operations use a "best effort" approach:
- Delivery failures do not block the primary operation (create/update)
- Errors are logged but do not prevent the user from saving changes
- Failed deliveries can be retried manually

**Checking for Issues**:
1. View backend logs for delivery errors
2. Check Git status for uncommitted changes
3. Review notification history for failed manual deliveries

**Common Issues**:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Git clone fails | Invalid credentials | Verify PAT has `repo` scope |
| Push rejected | Remote has newer commits | Pull before pushing |
| YAML not generated | Entity type not supported | Check supported entity types |
| Direct mode no effect | Dry run enabled | Disable dry run for real changes |

### Best Practices

#### GitOps Workflow

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Use Git as the authoritative source for configurations
2. **Pull Requests**: Require PR reviews for production changes
3. **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for development
4. **Automated Testing**: Run validation in CI before merge
5. **Automated Deployment**: Deploy from Git to target environments

#### Security Considerations

1. **PAT Scope**: Grant minimal required permissions (only `repo`)
2. **Token Rotation**: Rotate Git tokens regularly (every 90 days)
3. **Audit Trail**: Use meaningful commit messages
4. **Access Control**: Limit who can push to production branches

#### Multi-Mode Strategy

1. **Redundancy**: Enable both Direct and Indirect for critical changes
2. **Verification**: Use Indirect mode's Git history to verify Direct mode applied correctly
3. **Fallback**: Manual mode as backup when automation fails

## Best Practices

### Organizational Setup

#### Start with Pilot Domain

1. Choose one well-defined domain
2. Create 1-2 teams
3. Build 2-3 data contracts
4. Publish 1-2 data products
5. Learn and iterate
6. Expand to other domains

#### Establish Governance Early

- Define naming conventions
- Create compliance policies
- Set up review workflows
- Document standards

#### Leverage Demo Mode

Enable `APP_DEMO_MODE` during initial setup to see examples:
- Sample domains, teams, projects
- Example contracts and products
- Pre-configured compliance policies
- Semantic model examples

Disable once you understand the system.

### Workflow Recommendations

#### Contracts First Approach (Recommended)

1. Define the data contract
2. Get contract approved
3. Build the product implementing the contract
4. Request product certification
5. Deploy to production

**Benefits**:
- Consumer needs are clear upfront
- Reduces rework
- Enables parallel development
- Formal quality commitments

#### Products First Approach (Exploration)

1. Build the data product
2. Derive contract from implementation
3. Get contract approved retroactively
4. Request product certification

**When to Use**: Experimentation, prototypes, unclear requirements

### Naming Conventions

#### General Rules

- **Lowercase**: Use lowercase for consistency
- **Snake Case**: Use underscores between words (`customer_orders`)
- **Descriptive**: Make names self-explanatory
- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Unless they're industry-standard

#### Specific Conventions

**Domains**:
- PascalCase: `Finance`, `CustomerSuccess`
- Clear boundaries: `Retail Operations` not `RetailOps`

**Teams**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `data-engineering`, `analytics-team`
- Include function: `finance-data-team`

**Projects**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-360-platform`
- Descriptive: `fraud-detection-ml-pipeline`

**Contracts**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-data-contract`
- Include domain: `finance-transactions-contract`

**Products**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-360-view`
- Include type: `pos-transaction-stream` (source)

**Tags**:
- Lowercase, no spaces: `pii`, `realtime`, `certified`
- Namespace with prefix: `domain:finance`, `type:aggregate`

### Semantic Linking Strategy

#### When to Link

**Always Link**:
- Important domain concepts
- PII and sensitive fields
- Customer and user identifiers
- Financial fields
- Core business entities

**Consider Linking**:
- Technical metadata fields
- Calculated fields with business meaning
- Aggregated metrics

**Don't Link**:
- Pure technical fields (e.g., `_created_at`, `_id`)
- Temporary columns in transformations
- System-generated fields with no business meaning

#### Three-Tier Linking

Apply semantic links at all three levels for maximum value:

1. **Contract → Business Domain**
2. **Schema → Business Entity**
3. **Property → Business Attribute**

This enables complete semantic traceability.

### Compliance Policy Strategy

#### Policy Categories

Organize policies by category:

- **Governance**: Naming, documentation, ownership
- **Security**: Encryption, access control, PII protection
- **Quality**: Completeness, accuracy, freshness
- **Operations**: Monitoring, SLOs, availability

#### Policy Severity

Assign appropriate severity:

- **Critical**: Security violations, data loss risks
- **High**: Governance requirements, quality issues
- **Medium**: Best practice violations
- **Low**: Recommendations, nice-to-haves

#### Progressive Enforcement

1. **Phase 1**: Create policies, run manually, generate reports
2. **Phase 2**: Enable automated runs, send notifications
3. **Phase 3**: Block deployments based on policy failures
4. **Phase 4**: Auto-remediation where possible

### Review Workflow Optimization

#### Request Grouping

Group related assets in single review requests:

**Good**:
- All tables for a data product
- Tables and views for a feature
- Assets being promoted together

**Avoid**:
- Mixing unrelated assets
- Too many assets (>10) in one request
- Assets not ready for review

#### Steward Assignment

Assign the right steward:

- **Domain Steward**: For domain-specific reviews
- **Security Officer**: For PII/security reviews
- **Technical Steward**: For complex technical assets
- **General Steward**: For routine reviews

#### Response Times

Set expectations:

- **Standard Reviews**: 2-3 business days
- **Urgent Reviews**: 1 business day (pre-arranged)
- **Complex Reviews**: Up to 1 week

Communicate timelines clearly.

### Data Product Lifecycle Management

#### Version Tagging

Tag products with version indicators:

- `v1`, `v2`, `v3` - Major versions
- `stable`, `beta`, `alpha` - Maturity
- `deprecated` - Products being sunset

#### Deprecation Process

When deprecating a product:

1. Announce 90 days in advance (minimum)
2. Mark product as "Deprecated" with sunset date
3. Communicate replacement product
4. Send reminders at 60, 30, and 7 days
5. Track consumer usage
6. Archive after sunset date
7. Keep documentation available

#### Consumer Communication

Notify consumers of changes:

- **Breaking Changes**: 90-day notice, major version bump
- **New Features**: Release notes, minor version bump
- **Bug Fixes**: Release notes, patch version bump
- **Deprecations**: Multiple reminders over 90 days

Use Ontos notifications and external channels (email, Slack).
