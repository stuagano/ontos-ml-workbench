# Mirion Data & AI Platform
## Executive Vision

**Mirion Technologies × Databricks**

*Transforming from Hardware Provider to Data-Driven Managed Services*

---

## The Opportunity

Mirion Technologies dominates radiation safety hardware with **95% penetration across 430+ global nuclear power plants**. However, the current transactional model limits growth:

- Revenue deceleration: 11.6% → 7.5% growth rate decline
- One-time hardware sales with 5-10 year replacement cycles
- Customer data siloed at each facility
- Competitive moat based solely on regulatory incumbency

**The MEDIAN + VITAL Platform transforms this position into a recurring-revenue managed services business.**

## The Program: Three Integrated Layers

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Timeline |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Foundation** | MEDIAN | "Lego brick" data platform - workspaces, ingestion, ETL, governance | Phase 1-2 |
| **Proof Point** | Sievo | Procurement analytics - validates platform with immediate business value | Phase 2 (March) |
| **AI Lifecycle** | VITAL | AI-powered managed services - templates, curation, training, deployment | Phase 3+ |

## The Vision

| Dimension | Current State | Future State (MEDIAN + VITAL) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Business Model** | Sell hardware, wait 5-10 years | Hardware + recurring managed service |
| **Revenue Type** | One-time transactions | 20% of ACV annually |
| **Customer Relationship** | Transactional | Continuous engagement |
| **Value Delivery** | Products | Outcomes |
| **Data** | Siloed at each customer | Centralized platform |
| **Competitive Moat** | Regulatory incumbency | Data + analytics + physics expertise |

---

## Why This Wins

### For Mirion
- **Software-like margins** vs. hardware margins
- **Recurring revenue** vs. one-time sales
- **Data moat** competitors cannot replicate
- **Platform for expansion** into adjacent industrial markets

### For Customers
- Replace 3-5 FTEs with managed service (**$200K+ savings per person**)
- Proactive anomaly detection vs. reactive break/fix
- Industry benchmarking via Data Clean Rooms
- Automated compliance reporting

### Unique Differentiator: The ACE Framework
The **ACE Framework** (Airgap, Cloud, Edge) enables air-gapped nuclear facilities to access cloud-like analytics without compromising safety. Competitors offering cloud-only solutions cannot serve the nuclear industry's security requirements.

## The Investment

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Total Commitment** | $10.7M over 5 years |
| **CoE Investment** | $1.5M immediate unlock |
| **Rollover Provision** | 10% ($1.05M) extends beyond term |
| **Payment Structure** | Aligned to consumption ramp |
| **Production Support** | $2.4M |

### Consumption Forecast

| Year | Target | Cumulative | Customers | Key Milestone |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Year 1 | $400K | $400K | 5-10 pilots | Foundation + MC Validation |
| Year 2 | $800K | $1.2M | 20-40 sites | Scale + Predictive Analytics |
| Year 3 | $1.5M | $2.7M | 50-86 sites | Optimize + ML-Driven |
| Year 4 | $2.8M | $5.5M | 86+ sites | Expand + Clean Rooms GA |
| Year 5 | $5.0M | $10.5M | 150+ sites | Industrial Expansion |

## The Physics Engine: Monte Carlo Simulations

Monte Carlo simulations are Mirion's technical differentiator. They transform calibration from an expensive, license-constrained bottleneck into a scalable competitive moat.

| Metric | Current State | With VITAL Platform |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Simulations per calibration | 1,000 - 5,000 | 100,000+ |
| Uncertainty in calibration | ±2-5% | ±0.1-0.5% |
| Time to deliver calibration | 2-3 weeks | Hours |
| Calibrations per physicist/year | 50-100 | 500+ |

**Key Insight:** Monte Carlo simulation isn't just a technical workload. It's the physics engine that makes the managed service valuable. Without scalable MC, VITAL Platform is just a dashboard. With scalable MC, it's a competitive moat.
